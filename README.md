# lexl
Lexl stands for LLM Executive Logic, but thats the name of the agent.

Lexl is a Context Data Logic (CDL) framework with the aim of enhancing the completeness and accuracy of responses from an LLM. Best used to get more *accurate* and *complete* answers.
you can try Lexl now as a live gem here:

https://gemini.google.com/gem/1tjKNryMjVKAs9I3vKVtZtJZ1DZ8t_rms?usp=sharing

Though, I suggest creating your own gem or downloading the raw .cdl.md and uploading it yourself with it -- it makes it easier to access later. This link is more of a live demo.

This repo is considered complete unless there is a lot of discussion that requires modification.

Other ways to use:

Create your own gemini gem, or just upload the file to a specific chat and away you go.
